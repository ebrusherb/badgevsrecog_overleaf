--------------------------
DONE
--------------------------
- memory (as time window)
- specifying correlation (index strength)
- misidentification of signal category or individual ID


--------------------------
LOW HANGING FRUIT
--------------------------
- group size {25,50,75,100}
- number of fights (can pull from whole 10,000 fight datasets at different points) {bin by 100's}
- number of categories (for categorizing badge intensity) (1:n) {2,5,10,15}
- index strength (strength of correlation between badge intensity and quality) (set correlation strength of group) (0:1) {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8}
- window size (ie memory of individuals)

--------------------------
STUFF TO QUANTIFY
--------------------------
- cost of memory!! (especially important on evolutionary timescale)

--------------------------
STUFF TO PLOT
--------------------------
- learning curves with error shading
- learning accuracy (plot accuracy as function of variables)
- learning time (<<)

plotting to-do's:
- figure out how to do the shading around lines (mean of mean learning curves with SE shading around global mean)


--------------------------
TO GET FROM LITERATURE
--------------------------
- how do individuals actually categorize others based on badges/signals?
- check Cody's pukeko paper for continuous signal and timescale of changes
- orangutan face disc size changes with rank


--------------------------
HIGHER-HANGING FRUIT
--------------------------
- third-party observations
- investigate invasibility of groups, both with mutant strategy individuals (individuals have badges when others have recognition, etc) or with cheaters


--------------------------
POST HACKATHON NEXT STEPS
--------------------------
- compare direct experience vs observation
- extend to look at invasibility? individuals with other strategies AND/OR cheaters?
